Here's a step-by-step guide in markdown format for preparing your NBA game data and building a prediction model:

### Step 1: Data Collection and Initial Inspection

- **Access Database**: Connect to your Superbase database where your NBA game data resides.

  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  from sqlalchemy import create_engine

  engine = create_engine('your_database_connection_string')
  df = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM your_nba_games_table', engine)
  ```

- **Inspect Data**: Check for basic data structure, column names, and initial statistics.
  ```python
  print(df.head())
  print(df.info())
  print(df.describe())
  ```

### Step 2: Data Cleaning

- **Handle Missing Values**: Decide whether to impute or drop missing data based on the importance of each feature.

  ```python
  # Example: dropping rows with any NA value
  df_clean = df.dropna()
  ```

- **Correct Data Types**: Ensure each column has the correct data type (e.g., dates as datetime, stats as float).

  ```python
  df_clean['game_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_clean['game_date'])
  ```

- **Remove Duplicates**: Check for and remove any duplicate entries.

  ```python
  df_clean.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
  ```

- **Normalize or Standardize**: For features like points or rebounds, consider scaling if you're planning to use algorithms sensitive to feature scale.

  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

  scaler = StandardScaler()
  numeric_features = ['points', 'rebounds', 'assists']  # Example columns
  df_clean[numeric_features] = scaler.fit_transform(df_clean[numeric_features])
  ```

### Step 3: Feature Engineering

- **Create New Features**:

  - Calculate rolling averages for key stats over the last 5 or 10 games.
  - Compute efficiency ratings or other advanced metrics if not available.

  ```python
  df_clean['avg_points_last_5'] = df_clean.groupby('team')['points'].rolling(window=5, min_periods=1).mean().reset_index(level=0, drop=True)
  ```

- **Feature Selection**: Use correlation matrices or feature importance from a preliminary model to select relevant features.

### Step 4: Data Splitting

- **Train-Test Split**: Split your data into training and testing sets. You might also want a validation set for hyperparameter tuning.

  ```python
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

  X = df_clean.drop(['win_loss', 'spread', 'total_points'], axis=1)  # Example target variables
  y_win = df_clean['win_loss']
  y_spread = df_clean['spread']
  y_total = df_clean['total_points']

  X_train, X_test, y_win_train, y_win_test, y_spread_train, y_spread_test, y_total_train, y_total_test = train_test_split(X, y_win, y_spread, y_total, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
  ```

### Step 5: Model Training

- **Choose Models**:

  - For win/loss: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier
  - For spread: Linear Regression or Random Forest Regressor if treating as regression
  - For total points: Linear Regression or Random Forest Regressor

  ```python
  from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

  # Example for win/loss prediction
  model_win = LogisticRegression()
  model_win.fit(X_train, y_win_train)

  # Example for total points prediction
  model_total = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
  model_total.fit(X_train, y_total_train)
  ```

### Step 6: Model Evaluation

- **Evaluate Models**:

  - Use appropriate metrics for each task (accuracy for classification, MSE/RMSE for regression).

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, mean_squared_error

  # Win/Loss
  y_win_pred = model_win.predict(X_test)
  print("Win/Loss Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_win_test, y_win_pred))

  # Total Points
  y_total_pred = model_total.predict(X_test)
  print("Total Points MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_total_test, y_total_pred))
  ```

### Step 7: Iteration and Tuning

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best parameters.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensure your model's performance is consistent across different subsets of your data.

### Step 8: Deployment

- **Model Saving**: Save your trained models for later use or integration into a prediction service.

  ```python
  import joblib

  joblib.dump(model_win, 'win_model.joblib')
  joblib.dump(model_total, 'total_points_model.joblib')
  ```

- **Real-Time Prediction Pipeline**: Set up a system where new game data can be processed through your cleaning steps and models to make predictions.

Remember, each step might require multiple iterations, especially in cleaning and feature engineering, based on the quality and complexity of your data. Keep refining your models as you gather more data or as the NBA season progresses.
