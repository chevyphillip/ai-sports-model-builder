2. Specialized Models
   - Line movement prediction
   - In-game adjustment models
   - Player prop impact analysis

### 4. Model Evaluation Framework

#### Metrics

1. Prediction Accuracy

   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
   - Classification metrics for H2H predictions
   - R-squared for regression tasks

2. Betting Performance
   - Return on Investment (ROI)
   - Kelly Criterion calculations
   - Sharpe Ratio
   - Maximum drawdown
   - Win rate at different odds ranges

#### Validation Strategies

1. Time-Based Split

   - Training: Historical data up to cutoff
   - Validation: Next season's games
   - Test: Most recent season

2. Cross-Validation
   - Time-series cross-validation
   - Season-based folding
   - Rolling window validation

### 5. Production Pipeline

#### Model Training

1. Data Preprocessing

   ```python
   def preprocess_data():
       # Load raw data
       # Clean and normalize
       # Feature engineering
       # Split into train/val/test
   ```

2. Model Training
   ```python
   def train_model():
       # Initialize model
       # Train on historical data
       # Validate performance
       # Save model artifacts
   ```

#### Prediction System

1. Real-time Predictions

   ```python
   def generate_predictions():
       # Load latest game data
       # Apply feature engineering
       # Generate predictions
       # Calculate confidence intervals
   ```

2. Monitoring and Logging
   ```python
   def monitor_performance():
       # Track prediction accuracy
       # Log betting performance
       # Monitor market movements
       # Alert on anomalies
   ```
