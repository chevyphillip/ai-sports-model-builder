# Project Requirements Documentation (PRD) for AI Sports Model Builder

## 1. Project Requirements
AI Sports Model Builder is a robust data science and statistical application tailored towards building AI Sports Models for NBA, NFL, and NHL players and game props. The idea of this application is to collect, store, and train historical sports data for teams and players and use that data to build and train AI models to make profitable predictions comparing the initial prediction to the actual outcome of a game or player prop by also leveraging Sport Odds data from the OddsAPI, Stathead, keggle (NFL,NHL,NBA).

The application is meant to adapt to the type of sports and apply the following methods and techniques when building and training AI models for sports prediction.

Sports betting algorithms and methods have become increasingly sophisticated, leveraging advanced statistical techniques and machine learning to find edges and value in betting lines. Here are some of the most common and widely used approaches:

## Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is a fundamental statistical method used in many sports betting models. It helps identify relationships between various factors and game outcomes. 

**Linear Regression**: This technique predicts continuous outcomes, such as the total number of points scored in a game.

**Logistic Regression**: Particularly useful for predicting binary outcomes, like win/loss probabilities[1].

## Machine Learning Models

Machine learning has revolutionized sports betting algorithms, offering powerful predictive capabilities:

**Neural Networks**: These complex models can identify intricate patterns in sports data, making them especially effective for live betting and analyzing complex sports[1].

**Decision Trees**: Useful for creating rule-based prediction models that handle multiple variables.

**Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Effective for classification tasks, such as predicting winners in head-to-head matchups.

## Monte Carlo Simulations

Monte Carlo simulations run thousands of game scenarios to predict different outcomes. This method is particularly valuable for:

- Modeling uncertainty in sports events
- Analyzing multi-outcome sports like soccer or NFL games[1]

## Bayesian Approaches

Bayesian methods are powerful for incorporating prior knowledge and updating predictions as new information becomes available. They're handy for:

- Adjusting probabilities based on in-game events
- Combining expert opinions with statistical data[6]

## Value Betting Algorithms

Value betting is a cornerstone strategy for many professional bettors. These algorithms work by:

1. Analyzing actual probabilities of sports event outcomes
2. Comparing them to bookmakers' odds
3. Identifying mispriced opportunities[2]

## Arbitrage Betting

While not a predictive model per se, arbitrage algorithms are used to:

- Exploit odds differences across multiple sportsbooks
- Guarantee profits by placing bets on all possible outcomes[3]

## Time Series Analysis

Time series models are crucial for analyzing trends and patterns in sports data over time. They're instrumental for:

- Predicting player performance based on historical data
- Analyzing team form and momentum

## Ensemble Methods

Combining multiple models often yields better results than individual algorithms. Standard ensemble techniques include:

- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting Machines

## Feature Engineering

While not an algorithm, sophisticated feature engineering is crucial for creating effective betting models. This involves:

- Identifying relevant statistics and metrics
- Creating new variables that capture complex relationships in sports data

## Reinforcement Learning

This advanced machine-learning technique is gaining traction in sports betting. It's beneficial for:

- Adapting to changing conditions in real-time
- Optimizing betting strategies over long periods[1]

## Discord bot automation and building

Predictions should be delivered via webhooks and CSV outputs using the discord API or local file system.

To implement these algorithms effectively, bettors need access to vast amounts of data, including historical game outcomes, player statistics, and even external factors like weather conditions[1]. The most successful models often combine multiple techniques, continuously adapting to new information and market conditions.

Remember, while these algorithms can provide valuable insights, successful sports betting also requires discipline, proper bankroll management, and an understanding of the inherent risks [7].
